The first project of the Linux Operating System course.

## How to use?
You can compile `main.c` with below command:
```
gcc -pthread -o main main.c
```

## Notices
- This repository can only be used in Linux OS (because the library `pthread.h` does not support other OS).
- You can get more information from [project description](https://github.com/Cing-Chen/Linux-Operating-System-Project-1/blob/main/Project_1_Description.pdf) and our [report](https://github.com/Cing-Chen/Linux-Operating-System-Project-1/blob/main/Project_1_Report.pdf).
