# Linux-Operating-System-Project-1
> @laimolee: jizz

This repository is the first project of Linux Operating System course during the autumn semester of 2022 at NCU.

## How to use?
You can compile `main.c` with below command:
```
gcc -pthread -o main main.c
```

## Notices
- This repository can only be used in Linux OS (because the library `pthread.h` does not support other OS).
